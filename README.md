## Flowchart

Below is a visual representation of the process flow for the AI Fashion Stylist. This flowchart outlines how the model processes data to deliver personalized outfit recommendations.

```python
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Open and display the flowchart image
img = Image.open("flowchart.png")
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
